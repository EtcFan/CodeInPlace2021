# CodeInPlace2021
A Repository for my final project for Code In Place 2021. 

All historical financial data was downloaded from Yahoo Finance. 

What does this program do? 

  It gives you the option to choose a set of financial data (e.g. GOOG for Alphabet stocks), a timeframe and set several benchmarks,
  such as minimum/maximum volatility and growth rate. 
  
  Then it gets the data for the given timeframe and calculates volatilty, growth rate and the average volume for the given timeframe. 
  It compares the data to the given benchmarkes and tells the user if the stock met their expectations. 
  
 How to use this program:
  1. Download all files from the repository
  2. Make sure you have the pandas libary installes (pip install pandas)
  3. Run the programm
